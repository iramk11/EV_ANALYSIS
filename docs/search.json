    "text": "1 Introduction\nThe shift towards electric vehicles (EVs) represents a crucial step in reducing greenhouse gas emissions and mitigating the effects of climate change. With governments worldwide pressing for greener alternatives, understanding the current landscape of electric vehicle adoption is key to effective policy and infrastructure. We have chosen this topic because electric vehicles are at the forefront in this transition to sustainable transport, and their adoption provides valuable information about consumer behavior, technology advances, and regional trends.\nElectric Vehicle Population data will be used to analyze the trends of distribution, characteristics, and adoption of electric vehicles across regions. Data regarding vehicle type, electric range, base MSRP, and geographic location will aid in answering specific questions:\n\nWhat are the most popular EV models?\nHow do electric ranges and costs vary across regions?\nWhat geographic patterns emerge in EV adoption?\n\nThis analysis will highlight a few major driving factors in the adoption of EVs and what challenges are to be met for such wide usage. By analyzing this dataset, we hope to find meaningful insights that will assist policymakers, utility companies, and carmakers in accelerating the process of electric vehicle adaptation.",

    "text": "2.1 Missing value analysis\nKnown Issues and Limitations The following are issues that were noted during exploration:\nMissing Values: Some missing values do exist in a few columns, like Legislative District, Vehicle Location, and Electric Range. This reduces the scope when analyzing some of these variables.\nGeographical scope: The given dataset doesn’t enable the view on nationwide or global views of how electric vehicle adoption is going on; it’s restricted to Washington State only.\nOutdated records: Records may not get updated often, and recent registrations or changes may not be reflected.\nData Cleaning: Categorical values or geographic identifiers may have inconsistencies that will need cleaning.\nData Import Plan: This is freely downloadable from the Data.gov catalog, in CSV format. First, this data was imported into this project using Python, where preliminary cleaning and some exploration had been done. Later, it would be loaded into R for analysis and visualization. This dataset provides a robust foundation for analyzing EV adoption and identifying trends, despite its geographic limitations and minor data quality issues.\nCode\n#install.packages(\"dplyr\") \n#install.packages(\"tidyr\")\nCode\nlibrary(ggplot2)\nlibrary(dplyr)\n\n\n\nAttaching package: 'dplyr'\n\n\nThe following objects are masked from 'package:stats':\n\n    filter, lag\n\n\nThe following objects are masked from 'package:base':\n\n    intersect, setdiff, setequal, union\n\n\nCode\nlibrary(tidyr)\n\nev_data &lt;- read.csv(\"Electric_Vehicle_Population_Data.csv\")\n\n# Calculate the number of missing values for each column\nmissing_data &lt;- ev_data %&gt;%\n  summarise(across(everything(), ~ sum(is.na(.)))) %&gt;%\n  pivot_longer(cols = everything(), names_to = \"Variable\", values_to = \"MissingValues\")\n\n# Create a bar chart with colored bars\nggplot(missing_data, aes(x = reorder(Variable, -MissingValues), y = MissingValues, fill = MissingValues)) +\n  geom_bar(stat = \"identity\") +\n  scale_fill_gradient(low = \"blue\", high = \"red\") +\n  labs(title = \"Missing Values by Variable\",\n       x = \"Variables\",\n       y = \"Number of Missing Values\") +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1))\nBar Graph: A graph representing the percent of missed values within the columns; the worst hit is found in the legislative District. The above bar plot quantitatively views the missing data in terms of their percentages. The highest rate of missing value is in the Legislative District column which is about 0.21%, hence the most affected variable in the dataset. Other columns include Vehicle Location, Electric Range, and Base MSRP. These all contain very few missing values, under 0.01%, and are relatively complete, probably without a huge effect on the analysis. Overall, this data is pretty complete; there are only a few columns in the entire set with missing information.\nCode\nlibrary(reshape2)\n\n\n\nAttaching package: 'reshape2'\n\n\nThe following object is masked from 'package:tidyr':\n\n    smiths\n\n\nCode\n# Create a binary missing value matrix (1 for missing, 0 for not missing)\nmissing_matrix &lt;- as.data.frame(is.na(ev_data))\nmissing_matrix &lt;- cbind(Row = 1:nrow(missing_matrix), missing_matrix)\n\n# Melt the data for ggplot\nmissing_long &lt;- melt(missing_matrix, id.vars = \"Row\")\n\n# Create the heatmap\nggplot(missing_long, aes(x = variable, y = Row, fill = value)) +\n  geom_tile() +\n  scale_fill_manual(values = c(\"pink\", \"black\"), labels = c(\"Not Missing\", \"Missing\")) +\n  labs(title = \"Heatmap of Missing Values\",\n       x = \"Variables\",\n       y = \"Rows\",\n       fill = \"Missing\") +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1))\nThe following heatmap shows the pattern of missing values across the dataset. Each vertical band here represents a column, with highlighted areas showing missing values. Most of the rows are fully filled, and the rest hold few missing values. There is no indication that the missing values clustered in rows, which therefore are most likely to be random and not related to some particular sub-set of the data. The columns most affected-only showing continuous gaps-include the Legislative District. This heat map confirms that the missing data points are not pervasive and affect only a small subset of the data.",

registrations in Washington State highlights a stark contrast between urban and rural counties. King County dominates with the highest registrations, followed by Snohomish and Pierce counties, reflecting the concentration of EV adoption in urban and suburban areas where infrastructure, population density, and access to charging stations are more favorable. In contrast, rural counties like Lincoln and Adams have significantly fewer registrations, underscoring the need for improved charging infrastructure and targeted incentives to promote adoption in these areas. This visualization emphasizes the critical role of equitable infrastructure expansion to ensure that EV adoption benefits all communities across the state.\nWhat is the relative contribution of the top EV makes to the total electric vehicle market in Washington State?\n\n\nCode\nlibrary(ggplot2)\nlibrary(dplyr)\n\n# Aggregate EV counts by make and calculate percentages\nmake_contribution &lt;- ev_data %&gt;%\n  group_by(Make) %&gt;%\n  summarize(Total_EVs = n()) %&gt;%\n  arrange(desc(Total_EVs)) %&gt;%\n  mutate(Percentage = Total_EVs / sum(Total_EVs) * 100)\n\n# Filter for the top 10 makes only\ntop_10_makes &lt;- make_contribution %&gt;%\n  slice_max(Total_EVs, n = 10)\n\n\n\nggplot(top_10_makes, aes(x = reorder(Make, -Total_EVs), y = Percentage, fill = Make)) +\n  geom_bar(stat = \"identity\") +\n  scale_fill_brewer(palette = \"Set3\") +\n  labs(title = \"Make Contribution to Total EVs\",\n       x = \"Make\",\n       y = \"Percentage of Total EVs\",\n       fill = \"Make\") +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe graph illustrates the contribution of different car manufacturers to the total electric vehicle (EV) market, with Tesla overwhelmingly leading at over 40% of the total share. This dominance reflects Tesla’s early entry into the EV market, innovative technology, and strong brand recognition. Other manufacturers like Chevrolet, Nissan, and Ford follow at much smaller shares, indicating growing but still limited competition. Notably, legacy automakers such as Toyota and Volkswagen hold minimal shares, highlighting the lag in transitioning to EVs. The disparity underscores Tesla’s market leadership while pointing to opportunities for other manufacturers to expand their EV offerings and capture a larger market share as consumer demand for sustainable transportation continues to rise.\nHow has the battery range of electric vehicles evolved across different model years in Washington State?\n\n\nCode\n# Ensure Electric.Range is numeric\nev_data$Electric.Range &lt;- as.numeric(ev_data$Electric.Range)\n\n# Filter for valid data\nev_filtered &lt;- ev_data %&gt;%\n  filter(!is.na(Electric.Range) & Electric.Range &gt; 0 & Model.Year &gt;= 2010)\n\n\nggplot(ev_filtered, aes(x = as.factor(Model.Year), y = Electric.Range, color = as.factor(Model.Year))) +\n  geom_jitter(alpha = 0.5, width = 0.2) +\n  scale_color_viridis_d(option = \"plasma\") +\n  labs(\n    title = \"Battery Range Distribution Across Model Years\",\n    x = \"Model Year\",\n    y = \"Electric Range (miles)\",\n    color = \"Model Year\"\n  ) +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt is a scatter of the ranges of electric vehicle batteries, in miles, over various model years in Washington State. There is, therefore, an apparent trend from the graph where the ranges have increased over the years; the older model years are always below 150 miles-for example, the 2010-2015 model years-whereas the newer model years, say 2020-2024, have heavy concentrations of values over 200 miles. This reflects both the advance in battery technology and the efforts of manufacturers to meet consumer demands for longer-range EVs. The wide spread in the ranges for recent years points as well to greater market diversity with options tailored to appeal to economy and performance-minded buyers. The visualization underlines how EV technology has moved fast, providing important insights into how the industry is working to extend its range capabilities.\nHow does the average electric range of vehicles vary by make, and how do Battery Electric Vehicles (BEVs) compare to Plug-in Hybrid Electric Vehicles (PHEVs) across different manufacturers? \n\n\nCode\n# Filter data for valid electric range and non-missing counties\nev_filtered &lt;- ev_data %&gt;%\n  filter(!is.na(Electric.Range) & Electric.Range &gt; 0 & !is.na(Make))\n\n# Aggregate data by County and Electric Vehicle Type\nmake_evtype_summary &lt;- ev_filtered %&gt;%\n  group_by(Make, Electric.Vehicle.Type) %&gt;%\n  summarize(Average_Range = mean(Electric.Range), .groups = \"drop\")\n\n# Create Cleveland dot plot\nggplot(make_evtype_summary, aes(x = Average_Range, y = Make, color = Electric.Vehicle.Type)) +\n  geom_point(size = 3, shape = 16) +  # Dot plot\n  geom_segment(aes(x = 0, xend = Average_Range, y = Make, yend = Make), color = \"gray\") +  # Horizontal lines\n  facet_wrap(~ Electric.Vehicle.Type, scales = \"free_y\") +  # Faceting by EV Type\n  labs(\n    title = \"Cleveland Dot Plot: Average Electric Range by Make\",\n    subtitle = \"Faceted by Electric Vehicle Type (BEV vs. PHEV)\",\n    x = \"Average Electric Range (miles)\",\n    y = \"County\"\n  ) +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBelow is the Cleveland dot plot of average electric range for the vehicles by manufacturer, faceted by Electric Vehicle Type: BEV versus PHEV. Among BEVs, Tesla has one of the largest averages of any manufacturer given its focus on long-range EV models of late. Other manufacturers offering competitive ranges include Porsche and Polestar, but these are rather more niche players. While PHEVs have comparatively much smaller average ranges, given that they are driven by the dual sources of electric and gasoline. In contrast, companies that emphasize PHEVs more as a luxury offering, such as Audi, BMW, and Volvo, all have shorter driving ranges compared to their BEV options. That, in a nutshell, is the technological difference between BEVs and PHEVs, with insight into how manufactures position themselves in the EV market: BEVs for long-distance drivers and PHEVs for hybrid needs.\nWhich vehicle manufacturers are the most popular among electric vehicle registrations in the state of Washington?\n\n\nCode\n# Bar Chart of Vehicle Make Distribution\nggplot(ev_data, aes(x = reorder(Make, -table(Make)[Make]))) +\n  geom_bar(fill = \"steelblue\") +\n  labs(title = \"Distribution of EVs by Vehicle Make\",\n       x = \"Vehicle Make\",\n       y = \"Number of Registrations\") +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis bar graph shows how highly concentrated the structure of EVs’ registrations is by the manufacturer. Tesla stands out in this lineup, with a very large difference in the count of its registrations compared to the others, showing how it leads the electric vehicle market. Other brands, such as Chevrolet, Nissan, and Ford, come afterward, with their count of registrations small enough to evidence very small market shares. It also underlines the “long tail” of manufacturers with few registrations, adding to the fragmentation in the rest of the market. Tesla has probably taken this leadership because of its well-established brand reputation, innovative technology, and well-developed charging infrastructure; it could have thus given stimuli for such enormous adoptions. That is to underline how Tesla is central in the EV market and how this can potentially be an opportunity for the rest of the manufacturers to develop their shares.\n*What is the percentage share of each electric vehicle model among all EV registrations in the dataset?\n\n\nCode\nmodel_data &lt;- ev_data %&gt;%\n  count(Model, name = \"Registrations\") %&gt;%\n  arrange(desc(Registrations)) %&gt;%\n  mutate(Percentage = (Registrations / sum(Registrations)) * 100)\n\ntop_model_data &lt;- model_data %&gt;%\n  slice_max(order_by = Registrations, n = 10) %&gt;%\n  mutate(Label = paste0(Model, \"\\n(\", round(Percentage, 1), \"%)\"))\n\n# Create a pie chart with percentages\nggplot(top_model_data, aes(x = \"\", y = Registrations, fill = Model)) +\n  geom_bar(stat = \"identity\", width = 1) +\n  coord_polar(theta = \"y\") +\n  geom_text(aes(label = paste0(round(Percentage, 1), \"%\")), \n            position = position_stack(vjust = 0.5), size = 2) + \n  labs(title = \"Percentage Share of EV Registrations by Model (Top 10)\",\n       x = NULL,\n       y = NULL) +\n  theme_void() +\n  theme(\n    plot.title = element_text(size = 14, hjust = 0.5),\n    legend.position = \"right\",\n    legend.text = element_text(size = 8))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe pie chart represents the top 10 vehicle model registrations of electric vehicles represented in this dataset. Hence, it comes out that Tesla Model Y leads the EV market with 21% of EVs registered, followed by Tesla Model 3, which constitutes 15.5%. Both model types contribute pretty high each to account for Tesla’s leading position regarding the same. Other prominent models, like the Nissan Leaf with 6.5%, and Ford Mustang Mach-E with 3.7%, have significantly smaller shares, underlining how scattered the market would be if Tesla is excluded. This graph depicts consumer preference, pointing out Tesla at the top-most position, probably due to technology, performance, and wide networks for charging. Similarly, the presence of other models like Chevrolet Bolt EV and Nissan Leaf indicates competitive effort by other manufacturers to appease a certain segment of the market. This provides a good overview of the general EV adoption that was really leptokurtic-dominated, with a small number of models taking the lion’s share of registrations. This will then provide insight into how best to identify opportunities for manufacturers to capture more significant shares of the market.\nHow have electric vehicle (EV) registrations changed over time?\n\n\nCode\n# Filter out year 2025 and aggregate data by Model Year\nyearly_data &lt;- ev_data %&gt;%\n  filter(Model.Year != 2025) %&gt;% # Exclude year 2025\n  group_by(Model.Year) %&gt;%\n  summarise(Registrations = n()) %&gt;%\n  arrange(Model.Year)\n\n\nggplot(yearly_data, aes(x = Model.Year, y = Registrations)) +\n  geom_line(color = \"blue\", size = 1) +\n  geom_point(color = \"red\", size = 2) +\n  labs(title = \"EV Registrations Over Time\",\n       x = \"Model Year\",\n       y = \"Number of Registrations\") +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  theme(\n    plot.title = element_text(size = 14, hjust = 0.5),\n    axis.title = element_text(size = 12),\n    axis.text = element_text(size = 10))\n\n\nWarning: Using `size` aesthetic for lines was deprecated in ggplot2 3.4.0.\nℹ Please use `linewidth` instead.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAbove is the line chart showing the trend in electric vehicle registration against time in Washington State, modeled from the years in the given dataset. It was extremely slow before the year 2010, wherein the total number of registrations remained very low. From around 2015, however, there is a definite uptick in the number of registrations probably reflecting huge leaps in technological, infrastructural, and economic viability with respect to EVs, or maybe consumer interest. The sharp spike in registration post-2020 may indicate a surge in EV adoption, probably catalyzed by increased environmental awareness, higher ranges provided by improved batteries, and state or federal incentives that exist for electric vehicles.\nAs such, a decline follows the peak year represented-2024 in the graph-maybe because of incomplete data from more recent years, disrupted supply chains, or market saturation. This proves how fast the adoption of EVs is taking place in Washington and points to sustained investment in charging infrastructure and supporting policy for maintaining these gains.\nHow have the top 5 electric vehicle (EV) makes performed in terms of annual over time? \n\n\nCode\ntime_series_data &lt;- ev_data %&gt;%\n  filter(!is.na(Make) & !is.na(Model.Year) & Model.Year &gt; 0 & Model.Year &lt; 2025) %&gt;% # Exclude 2025\n  count(Make, Model.Year, name = \"Count\") %&gt;%\n  group_by(Make) %&gt;%\n  summarise(Total = sum(Count)) %&gt;%\n  arrange(desc(Total)) %&gt;%\n  slice(1:5) %&gt;% # Select the top 5 makes by total registrations\n  inner_join(ev_data %&gt;%\n               count(Make, Model.Year, name = \"Count\"), by = \"Make\") %&gt;%\n  filter(Model.Year &lt; 2025) %&gt;% # Ensure 2025 is excluded in the joined data\n  arrange(desc(Total), Model.Year)\n\n# Plot the time series\nggplot(time_series_data, aes(x = Model.Year, y = Count, color = Make, group = Make)) +\n  geom_line(size = 1) +\n  geom_point(size = 2, alpha = 0.7) +\n  labs(\n    title = \"Time Series of Top 5 EV Makes Over Time\",\n    subtitle = \"Tracking the number of EV registrations by year\",\n    x = \"Model Year\",\n    y = \"Number of Registrations\",\n    color = \"Make\"\n  ) +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  theme(\n    plot.title = element_text(size = 16, hjust = 0.5),\n    plot.subtitle = element_text(size = 12, hjust = 0.5),\n    axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1),\n    legend.title = element_text(size = 12),\n    legend.text = element_text(size = 10)\n  )\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe following is a time series plot showing electric vehicle registration by the top five manufacturers, Tesla, Chevrolet, Ford, Nissan, and Kia, over time in Washington State, excluding 2025 data. Tesla is also, by a wide margin, the leading make that sees a significant ramp-up in its registrations from about 2015 and peaks just before 2025. The steep growth trajectory undertaken by Tesla reflects its strong presence in the market and appeal, probably due to innovations and the expanding availability of models. Other leading manufacturers such as Chevrolet and Nissan have revealed a more steady, gradual year-on-year increase in their registrations-a reflection of their persistent contribution to the EV market. The noticeable growth of Ford and Kia in recent years reveals increasing competitiveness and traction in their EVs. Based on this analysis, Tesla dominates the Washington EV market, and emerging competition among other EV manufacturers can be expected as EV adoption expands.\nWhich models are most popular for each vehicle manufacturer (make)?\n\n\nCode\nheatmap_data &lt;- ev_data %&gt;%\n  count(Make, Model, name = \"Registrations\") %&gt;%\n  group_by(Make) %&gt;%\n  mutate(TotalByMake = sum(Registrations)) %&gt;%\n  ungroup() %&gt;%\n  arrange(desc(TotalByMake), desc(Registrations)) %&gt;%\n  slice_max(order_by = TotalByMake, n = 30) %&gt;% \n  slice_max(order_by = Registrations, n = 30, by = Make) \n\n# Create the heatmap\nggplot(heatmap_data, aes(x = Make, y = Model, fill = Registrations)) +\n  geom_tile(color = \"white\") +\n  scale_fill_gradient(low = \"lightblue\", high = \"darkblue\", name = \"Registrations\") +\n  labs(title = \"Heatmap of Models by Vehicle Make (Top 30)\",\n       x = \"Vehicle Make\",\n       y = \"Vehicle Model\") +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  theme(\n    axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1, size = 10),\n    axis.text.y = element_text(size = 8),\n    plot.title = element_text(size = 14, hjust = 0.5)\n\n  )\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat factors might be contributing to the significant variation in EV adoption rates across different counties in Washington State, and what targeted strategies could be implemented to encourage higher adoption in rural areas?\n\n\nCode\nlibrary(tigris)\nlibrary(sf)\nlibrary(dplyr)\nlibrary(tmap)\n\n\nBreaking News: tmap 3.x is retiring.

King County clearly stands out as the leader in EV registrations, represented by the darkest shade on the color scale. This reflects the county’s advanced infrastructure, higher urban population density, and likely greater financial capacity to adopt electric vehicles. Surrounding counties, such as Pierce and Snohomish, show moderate EV adoption, likely benefiting from their proximity to King County and access to shared infrastructure and incentives.\nIn contrast, the lighter shades in rural counties indicate significantly lower EV adoption levels, which can be attributed to factors such as limited charging station availability, lower population densities, and possibly fewer incentives or awareness campaigns in these areas. The map emphasizes the need for targeted infrastructure development and policy support to encourage EV adoption in less-populated counties, reducing disparities and enhancing statewide sustainability efforts.\nHow do the battery ranges of electric vehicles vary across different manufacturers?\n\n\nCode\n# Clean the data: Remove rows with 0 or missing Electric Range\ncleaned_data &lt;- ev_data %&gt;%\n  filter(!is.na(Electric.Range) & Electric.Range &gt; 0)\n\n# Create the boxplot\nggplot(cleaned_data, aes(x = Make, y = Electric.Range, fill = Make)) +\n  geom_boxplot(outlier.color = \"red\", outlier.shape = 16, alpha = 0.7) +\n  labs(title = \"Boxplot of Battery Range by Make\",\n       x = \"Vehicle Make\",\n       y = \"Battery Range (Miles)\") +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  theme(\n    axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1, size = 10),\n    axis.title = element_text(size = 12),\n    legend.position = \"none\", # Remove legend for simplicity\n    plot.title = element_text(size = 14, hjust = 0.5)\n\n  )\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe boxplot shows the distribution of the battery range over various electric vehicle manufacturers or makes in this dataset. The chart hints at large variability amongst the different manufacturers in this market, though a few continuously set higher standards. Tesla leads, it appears, with quite a large spread in the long-range EV category-mostly because it has focused on the premium segments of high-end models. Audi and Porsche are at relatively high median positions, too, witness the presence of electric luxury vehicles.\nBy contrast, the other manufacturers-Fiat, MINI, and Mitsubishi-return fairly short ranges; doubtless, these will be priced to appeal to thrifty buyers or urban-limited EV range needs. The red outliers are rarely used models running much higher or lower for each brand. This plot underlines the heterogeneity in the EV market, with different manufacturers targeting different segments, everything from high range and high performance to more economic and city-centric options. This will help determine how range can become one of the differentiating factors among the EV brands for helping in consumer preference and market positioning.\nHow are EV charging stations distributed across counties in the dataset?\n\n\nCode\ntop_counties &lt;- ev_data %&gt;%\n  count(County, name = \"Charging_Stations\") %&gt;%\n  arrange(desc(Charging_Stations)) %&gt;%\n  slice_max(order_by = Charging_Stations, n = 10)\n\n# Create the bar chart\nggplot(top_counties, aes(x = reorder(County, -Charging_Stations), y = Charging_Stations, fill = County)) +\n  geom_bar(stat = \"identity\") +\n  labs(title = \"Top 10 Counties by Number of EV Charging Stations\",\n       x = \"County\",\n       y = \"Number of Charging Stations\") +\n  scale_fill_brewer(palette = \"Paired\") + \n  theme_minimal() +\n  theme(\n    axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1, size = 10), \n    axis.title = element_text(size = 12),\n    plot.title = element_text(size = 14, hjust = 0.5),\n    legend.position = \"none\" \n  )\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe following bar chart represents the number of electric vehicle-charging stations across the state of Washington, focusing on the top 10 counties. Against the rest of the counties, King County stands at a very high level regarding the number of charging stations, very telling about its centrality with respect to this issue. The rest, in order of numbers, are Snohomish and Pierce counties, though their totals are far fewer, meaning infrastructure in highly urbanized, densely populated areas is concentrated. In the middle-range counties, there is Clark, Thurston, and Kitsap. Spokane, Whatcom, Benton, and Skagit complete the top 10, but their contribution becomes disproportionately smaller compared to the previous ones.\nThe above visualization highlights the disparities that exist geographically in the state’s EV charging infrastructure. King County’s preeminence speaks to its urban nature and likely higher rates of EV adoption, favored by both government incentives and private investment. For this project, understanding this distribution is important in identifying areas that are not well served and should factor into an expansion strategy of the EV charging network. These disparities, if addressed, can facilitate broader EV adoption and support statewide sustainability goals.",

    "text": "This project comprehensively analyzed electric vehicle adoption trends in Washington State by using different visualizations to gain insight into EV registrations, dominance by manufacturers, the evolution of battery ranges, and their geographic distribution. From our analysis, it is clear that Tesla maintains the leading position in the EV market, with more than 40% of total registrations, followed by significant contributors like Chevrolet and Nissan. This is due to the innovative approach taken by Tesla in the manufacture of long-range, high-performance EVs that really appeal to consumers in Washington. The pie and bar charts in the following contributions highlighted the competitive landscape for both established and emerging players in the growing EV market.\nGeographic analysis demonstrated large disparities in EV adoption among counties, led by King County with more than 107,000 registrations. Ferry and Lincoln are among those sparsely populated rural counties that count only a few registered EVs, probably because of less infrastructure and a low density of the population. This suggests that more differentiated policies and investment in extending EV infrastructure in rural areas are needed to reduce disparities in adoption. From this map visualization, what came out immediately was that the EV adoption was an essentially urban phenomenon with high access to charging stations and population density. From the angle of the vehicle’s attributes, we extracted the fact that battery ranges have hugely increased over time and, for most of the new models starting after 2020, are usually above 200 miles. Once more, Tesla is at the top of this, together with other high-end brands such as Porsche and Polestar.Comparison through a Cleveland dot plot for PHEVs and BEVs is point to point. BEVs concentrated on capability over long distances, while for PHEVs, the utility is as a hybrid and short-range vehicle.\nIn general, this analysis underlines rapid technological development, increasing competitiveness of the EV market, and further challenges and opportunities for wider spread across the state. Clear comprehension of the outlined trends will enable stakeholders, policymakers, and manufacturers to better plan the future of growth while striving to ensure that Washington maintains its leading position in EV adoption and effectively responds to the barriers in underserved areas.",
