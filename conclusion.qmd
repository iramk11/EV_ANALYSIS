# Conclusion


The project developed valuable insights into electric vehicle adoption trends in Washington State, showing Tesla's dominant position with over 40% share of total registrations and significant contributions from Chevrolet and Nissan. Further geographic analysis of EV adoption showed wide disparities: on top was King County, followed by other urban counties, while rural counties like Ferry and Lincoln trailed far behind due to a lack of infrastructure. Battery-range analysis over time showed most improved, with newer models going along with more than 200 miles and Tesla, Porsche, and Polestar leading in that category. BEVs vs. PHEV comparison indicated that BEVs would specialize more often in a long-range performance opposed to the hybrid utility from PHEVs. All Together, these results underline the rapid development of EV technology, increasing market diversity, and the need for expanded infrastructure to ensure equitable EV adoption.
